# Guess My Number  
A simple number guessing game where the user guesses a number form 1-20. Incorrect guesses decrease the score and inform the user whether their guess was higher or lower than the generated number. They then continue to guess until the correct number is chosen or the score reaches zero. Highscore is also tracked if multiple games are played consecutively. The base html and css files for this project were provided by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).  

The game can be played [here](https://christopher-polloni.github.io/Guess-My-Number/).
